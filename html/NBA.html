        <td>What is being <strong>digitized?</strong></td>
        <td>Tattoos of NBA players were digitized in the video game NBA 2K <u>without the explicit permission</u> of the tattoo artists.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>What is the <u>goal</u>or <u>purpose</u> of digitizing this thing?</td>
        <td>The purpose of digitizing NBA players' tattoos in the video game NBA 2K was to enhance the game's realism,
          in
          the appearances of the players, which included their tattoos.

        <td>The creators and publishers of 2K20, Take-Two Interactive Software benefit from digitizing tattoos in the

          article.
        </td>
        <td>The digitalization of tattoos is not better or worse for our world. The Judge in the article describes is
          shown evidence that the tattoos in-game are hardly visible to the naked eye, and do not interfere with
          gameplay.</td>
