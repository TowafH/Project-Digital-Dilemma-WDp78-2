    <h1>Judge Rules in Favor of 'NBA 2K' Creators in Case Brought by Tattoo Artists</h1>
    <h3>By Michael Mccann</h3>
  </center>
  <p><span style="color:orange" ;>The tattoo artists whose designs appear in NBA 2K aren't paid as part of the licensing
      agreement between the company that produces the video game series and the NBA. Should they have been?
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:purple;"> Comment: Tattoos of NBA players were digitized in the video game NBA 2K without the
      explicit permission of the tattoo artists.</span>
    <br>
    When the NBA eventually returns from hiatus, we‚Äôll once again see dunks, blocks, steals and . . . tattoos. One study
    has found that about 56% of NBA players are tattooed. In contrast, approximately 35%
    of American adults are inked,though among millennials the percentage is a more-NBA-like 47%. Many NBA players are
    adorned with multiple tattoos. By one count, Philadelphia 76ers forward Mike Scott has an eye-catching 45 of them.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:orange;"> The prevalence of tattoos on NBA players is not a legal issue. However, the depiction
      of those tattoos in video games has become a unique controversy impacting both the sports and gaming
      communities.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:orange;">So, who ‚Äúowns‚Äù a video game representation of an NBA player‚Äôs tattoo?</span> There are
    several possibilities, including: the tattooist who designed the tattoo; the real-life player whose skin shows the
    tattoo; the company that created the code for the video game; the video game player who paid for the game; the
    public at large; or no one.
    <br>
    <br>
    This question centers on the likenesses of NBA players as displayed through avatars in the popular game series NBA
    2K. On Mar. 26, Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a
    ruling that will be studied closely by copyright attorneys and legal scholars. It‚Äôs also a ruling that could face a
    federal appeal. üòê Judge Swain granted summary judgment in favor of 2K Games and Take-Two Interactive Software, the
    publishers of NBA 2K. They are defendants in a case brought by a company that disputes the game‚Äôs display of
    players‚Äô tattoos.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>
      <h2><strong>NBA 2K, the licensing of NBA players‚Äô likenesses and tattoos</strong></h2>
    </center>
  <p><span style="color:green;">+NBA 2K is familiar to most sports fans. A new version of the series is published
      annually. At full price, the game retails for $59.99. In 2019, +NBA 2K20 was the second-highest selling video game
      behind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 and ahead of Madden NFL 20. </span> As of two months ago, NBA 2K20 had
    sold
    eight million units. NBA 2K20 is also featured in the NBA‚Äôs esports league, a joint venture between the NBA and
    Take-Two. Real NBA players are currently taking part in an NBA 2K tournament.
    <br>
    <br>
    The success of the NBA 2K series partly reflects the game‚Äôs intense realism. <span style="color:orange;">NBA 2K‚Äôs
      avatars are intended to resemble their real-life counterparts as closely as possible. This is true in how the
      avatars represent players‚Äô skills and physical appearances, right down to the fine details of tattoos.</span> In
    fact, NBA 2K players can purchase additional tattoos through ‚Äúmicrotransactions,‚Äù which are in-game purchases that
    unlock added features.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:purple;"> Comment: The purpose of digitalizing NBA players' tattoos in the video game NBA 2K was
      to
      enhance the game's realism, in the appearances of the players, which included their tattoos.</span> <br> <br> The
    licensing of NBA players‚Äô names, images and likenesses‚Äîsave for tattoos‚Äîis not a legal controversy. <span
      style="color:orange;">The NBA and the National Basketball Players‚Äô Association have crafted policies that
      explicitly
      authorize this licensing.</span> Take-Two pays a hefty fee, shared by the league and players, for the right to
    digitize all ‚Äúthings‚Äù that make the NBA so distinctive. Last year, <span style="color:orange;">Take-Two agreed to
      pay
      up to $1.1 billion over a seven-year period for the ability to publish games with NBA properties.</span>s Lifelike
    representations of team logos, arenas and players can thus be lawfully featured in NBA 2K games. <span
      style="color:green;">+This arrangement seems like a win for everyone, including the millions of people who play
      the
      game on their Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, PC, Mac and other devices
      and
      platforms.</span> <br> <br> <span style="color:purple;"> Comment: The creators and publishers of 2K20, Take-Two
      Interactive Software benefit from
      the situation. They profit from the sales and popularity of the game.I believe these impacts are intended because
      game developers and publishers put a lot of effort into creating realistic representations of players to enhance
      the
      gaming experience, which leads to an increase in sales. The game-publisher must emulate the players virtually as
      best as they can to their real-life counterparts.</span><br> <br> Well, not so fast. <span style="color:orange;">Not
      everyone agrees that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwin.‚Äù And not everyone agrees this arrangement is entirely legal.</span> <br>
    <br>üòêEnter the tattoo artists whose designs appear in NBA 2K. They aren‚Äôt part of
      Take-Two‚Äôs billion-dollar contract with the NBA. They haven‚Äôt been paid, either. Should they have been?
    <br> <br><span style="color:purple;"> Comment: I don't think anyone is being physically harmed through the
      digitalization of tattoos. It is mostly a legal dispute, which is motivated by wanting money for your intellectual
      property.</span>
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2><strong>The copyright case against NBA 2K</strong></h2>
  </center>
  <p>üòê<span style="color:red">-Four years ago, Solid Oak Sketches, a company that holds copyright license agreements with tattooists who have
    inked NBA players, filed its complaint in federal court.</span> Solid Oak has been represented by attorneys Darren Heitner, Paul
    Haberman and Matthew Spirtz, while the defendants have retained attorneys Dale Cendali, Catherine Seibel, Emma Raviv
    and Joshua Simmons.
    <br>
    <br>
    üòêSolid Oak argues that the defendants infringed on the copyrights connected to the tattoos. The company‚Äôs complaint
    focuses on five tattoos that are depicted on avatars associated with LeBron James, Kenyon Martin and Eric Bledsoe in
    the 2K14, 2K15 and 2K16 games. Solid Oak insists that Two-Take had no right to publicly display those tattoos
    without
    its permission.
    <br>
    <br>
    Solid Oak‚Äôs basic legal argument hinges on the application of copyright law to tattoos and an assessment of whether
    digitizing the tattoos is allowable via certain defenses, including <span style="color:orange;">de minimis use and implied license.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    A brief primer on copyright law may be helpful. A copyright exists from the moment the work is created and fixed in
    tangible form. A photograph, novel and other artistic productions can all be copyrighted. Broadly speaking, <span
      style="color:green;"> +copyright law attempts to balance protections for content creators with access to creative
      works. If it was very easy to ‚Äústeal‚Äù someone else‚Äôs work, there would be less incentive for creativity. At the
      same
      time, public access to creations helps to promote knowledge and can spark further innovation.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:orange;">Holders of copyrights generally enjoy the right to control the reproduction of their
      creative works. They can thus demand financial compensation for a license.</span> That issue is at the heart of
    photographer Steve Mitchell‚Äôs ongoing copyright infringement case against LeBron James. Without Mitchell‚Äôs
    permission,
    James used Mitchell‚Äôs photos of him in social media posts.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are two core requirements for a work to obtain copyright protection. One is originality and the other is
    fixation. Originality is straightforward. A tattoo design must be original and not copied.
    <br>
    <br>
    <span style="color:orange">The second requirement, fixation, is a little more intricate.</span> Under the federal Copyright Act, a work is ‚Äúfixed‚Äù in
    a
    tangible medium of expression ‚Äúwhen its embodiment . . . is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be
    perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.‚Äù A tattoo reflects a
    design imprinted onto the skin. Specifically, a needle inserts ink into the dermis layer, thereby altering the
    pigment. Absent a removal procedure, the imprint is permanent.
    <br>
    <br>
    <center>
      <h2><strong>Previous cases involving athletes‚Äô tattoos and representation in video games</strong></h2>
    </center>
    <p>Tattoos can be copyrighted. There have also been noteworthy copyright cases involving tattoos of NBA players and
    video
    games showing athletes‚Äô tattoos. However, those cases settled out of court, meaning they don‚Äôt provide precedent.
    <br>
    <br>
    One of those cases involved retired NBA player Rasheed Wallace. üòê In 2005, a tattooist named Matthew Reed sued Nike
    and Wallace, who at the time played for the Detroit Pistons, for infringement. The case concerned a tattoo on
    Wallace‚Äôs arm. Reed had designed the tattoo with Wallace‚Äôs involvement. The tattoo was then featured in a Nike
    commercial. <span style="color:orange;"> Did Wallace and Nike need Reed‚Äôs permission for the commercial, or did they
      gain that right as part of Wallace hiring Reed to create the tattoo?</span>We‚Äôll never know: the case ended in a
    settlement.
    <br>
    <br>
    Seven years later, a tattooist named Christopher Escobedo sued video game publisher THQ over the game UFC Undisputed
    3. The game showed a representation of a lion tattoo on the rib cage of MMA fighter Carlos Condit, whose name, image
    and likeness had been licensed to appear in the game. Escobedo had registered a sketch of the tattoo with the U.S
    Copyright Office. Escobedo claimed that he never granted a license for his design to appear in a video game. The
    case
    was resolved without a decision on the merits in part because THQ filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. üòêHowever, a
    bankruptcy court later awarded Escobedo $22,500. Although the bankruptcy court never explained its award to
    Escobedo,
    the fact that it awarded him money signaled his case may have had some merit. Escobedo later appealed the award on
    grounds that the dollar amount was insufficient. He would reach a settlement out of court.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Solid Oak case is similar to the one brought by Escobedo. Both involve a sports video game‚Äôs representation of a
    tattoo on an athlete whose name, image and likeness lawfully appear in the game. The core question is whether the
    license to the athlete‚Äôs likeness encompasses tattoos. If the tattoo is part of the athlete‚Äôs appearance, like other
    skin features, the video game company would have a stronger argument that it didn‚Äôt need to pay the tattooist. But
    if  the tattoo design is a distinguishable feature that isn‚Äôt covered in a licensing agreement, the tattooist would
    likely be advantaged.</p>
  <center><h2><strong>Unpacking Judge Swain‚Äôs ruling</strong></h2></center>
  <p>Take-Two persuaded Judge Swain to dismiss Solid Oak‚Äôs complaint through summary judgment. It did so primarily by
  stressing that the use of tattoos on James, Martin and Bledsoe was de minimis and that Take-Two had implied
  authorization. Take-Two also convinced Judge Swain that the doctrine of fair use applies. By entering summary
  judgment,üòêthe judge concluded that no reasonable trier of fact could find for Solid
    Oak.
  <br>
  <br>
  It‚Äôs worth unpacking Judge Swain‚Äôs conclusions. First consider de minimis use. In order for a copyright infringement
  claim to prevail, the amount of copied material must be more than trivial. Judge Swain‚Äôs ruling focuses on the minimal
  presence of tattoos in the game. She observes that ‚ÄúNBA 2K users do not see the tattoos clearly, if at all, during
  gameplay‚Äù and that tattoos are only apparent as part of a player‚Äôs avatar.
  <br>
  <br>
  Judge Swain further maintains the tattoos of the three players in question only appear on screen <span
    style="color:orange;"> at a size of 4.4% to 10.96% of their actual sizes.</span> In addition, the tattoos only
  reflect between only 0.000286% to 0.000431% of the game‚Äôs data. For those reasons, the judge concludes, the video
  game-version of the tattoos aren‚Äôt substantially similar to the real ones. During the litigation, Take-Two‚Äôs defense
  insisted that because NBA players‚Äô avatars are both moving quickly on-screen and jostling for position with other
  avatars (like real NBA players would do in a real game), and because the tattoos are relatively small, the typical
  gamer‚Äôs eyes seldom observes the tattoos as nothing more than a blur. Along those lines, the defense asserted that the
  tattoos are no more noticeable than the nose shape of a player‚Äôs avatar.
    <br>
  <br>
  Judge Swain also reasons that the tattoos are not an important part of the video game itself. She notes that tattoos
  aren‚Äôt featured in any of the game‚Äôs marketing materials.üòê The judge‚Äôs ruling also draws attention to consumer data,
  provided by an expert witness retained by the defense. The data showed that consumers don‚Äôt buy NBA 2K games because
  of players‚Äô tattoos.
    <br>
  <br>
  üòêJudge Swain also places importance in the fact that Solid Oak has never licensed its
    designs in video games. The absence of such licensing arguably implies there is no intellectual property
  requiring a license.
    <br>
    <br>
  Take-Two also presented Judge Swain with an influential argument that the company possessed an implied license through
  its express contract with the NBA. This purported license, Take-Two maintained, included tattoo designs. In other
  words, even if the contract with the NBA didn‚Äôt mention tattoos, it nonetheless implied a right to include tattoos as
  part of the players‚Äô likenesses.
    <br>
  <br>
  The word ‚Äúimplied‚Äù is therefore crucial. It means that Take-Two had no explicit license to use the tattoo designs. The
  company overcame this hurdle by obtaining key testimony from the tattooists. üòêThey retold how James, Martin and
  Bledsoe all requested certain types of individualized tattoos, how those tattoos were then designed and, lastly, inked
  onto the players‚Äô skin. As summarized by Judge Swain, üòê the tattooists also acknowledged that
    they knew players would display their tattoos in public, including in commercials and in other forms of
    media. In other words, the tattoos had seemingly become part of the players‚Äô likenesses, just like the rest
  of their bodies.
    <br>
  <br>
  Take-Two also prevailed by arguing that its use of the tattoo designs reflected fair use. The Copyright Act allows for
  the fair use of a copyrighted work for such purposes as criticism, comment, news reporting and research. When fair use
  applies, copying another‚Äôs work is not infringement.
    <br>
    <br>
  In determining if fair use is present, courts consider (among other factors) whether the use is ‚Äútransformative.‚Äù A
  transformative use is one that has a different purpose from the original purpose.
    <br>
  <br>
  Here, Judge Swain highlights that the two sets of tattoos‚Äîthe real ones and those in the video game‚Äîwere designed for
  very different purposes. <span style="color:green;"> Tattooists crafted the tattoos to reflect the expression of a
    player‚Äôs identity. James, for example, hired tattooist Justin Wright to craft a tattoo that incorporated a baby
    picture. This tattoo, dubbed Child Portrait, was about James expressing himself in a personal way. Now consider why
    Take-Two programmers replicated that same Child Portrait tattoo. They did so to make James seem as real as possible
    in NBA 2K.</span> From that lens, the tattoos in NBA 2K are not about players expressing themselves but rather about
  making the game mimic everything about the players. </p>
  <center><h3><strong>Next steps</strong></h3></center>
  <p>The case is over‚Äîfor now. Solid Oak could appeal Judge Swain‚Äôs order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
  Circuit. Given how this legal topic is relatively new and very debatable, Solid Oak might see the value in petitioning
  a panel of three appellate judges to review the same set of issues. During the litigation, Solid Oak‚Äôs attorneys
  repeatedly argued that the tattoo licensing agreements never contained a right for Take-Two to use the tattoos. It‚Äôs
  possible that line of reasoning might prove more persuasive on appeal. <br><br>We‚Äôll keep you posted on key developments.</p>

    <h1>DNA Testing Kits & The Security Risks in Digitized DNA</h1>
    <h3>By Candice Lanier</h3>
  </center>
  <p>Direct-to-consumer DNA testing services have experienced a surge in popularity over the past few years. <span
      style="color:green">Digitizing DNA carries the benefits of uncovering ancestry information and can have
      significant positive impact on science and medical research. It can, for instance, assist in finding a cure for a
      fatal disease.</span> <br> <br> <span style="color:purple"> Comment: The goal of digitizing DNA is to help find cures for fatal disease, provide medical information and solving of criminal cases , but it inadvertently raised security concerns by cyber threats</span> </p>
  <center>
    <h2>Cyberbiosecurity</h2>
  </center>
  <p><span style="color:red">-According to Peccoud Lab, which specializes in synthetic biology informatics at Colorado
      State University, Cyberbiosecurity is a specialty that deals with understanding and mitigating new biological
      security risks emerging at the interface between biosecurity and cybersecurity.</span> <span style="color:orange">The digitization of DNA involves its storage in a database.</span> üòêThe solving of a criminal
    cold case through matching a consumer DNA database with a police database is another example of how digitized DNA can be used. <br> <br> <span style="color:purple"> Comment: DNA, which was obtained through direct-to-consumer DNA testing services was digitalized.</span> <br> <br> <span style="color:purple"> Comment: The direct-to-consumer DNA testing services benefit individuals seeking their health information. Additionally, the companies that provide these services will benefit financially.</span> </p>
  <center>
    <h2>The Risks</h2>
  </center>
  <p><span style="color: red;">-The addition of digitized DNA provides hackers with another target to exploit and opens
      up a new and challenging frontier for cybersecurity professionals. There are significant implications involved in
      digitizing DNA.</span>
    <br>
    <br>"The cyber-physical nature of biotechnology raises unprecedented security concerns," coauthors Jean Peccoud,
    Jenna E. Gallegos, Randall Murch, Wallace G. Buchholz, and Sanjay Raman explain in their research paper titled,
    Cyberbiosecurity: From Naive Trust to Risk Awareness. <span style="color:red">-"Computers can be compromised by
      encoding malware in DNA sequences, and biological threats can be synthesized using publicly available
      data." </span><br> <br> <span style="color:purple"> Comment: I believe that Digitizing DNA is intended for good reasons such as finding criminals for crime scenes, but eventually leads to unintended consequences such as cybersecurity risks and data exploitation.</span> 
    <br> <br> <span style="color:purple"> Comment: Digitizing DNA can harm people whose genetic data can be exploited, which leads to privacy breaches, medical denial, or through framing in a crime scene.
</span> 
  </p>
  <center>
    <h2>Potential security risks include:</h2>
  </center>
  <ul>
    <li>Representations of genes could be used to make biologic weapons.</li>
    <li>Because vulnerabilities exist in computers, <span style="color:red">-hackers could compromise a device, with the
        intent to stall the production of critical drugs, for example.</span> This could be accomplished by using a
      methodology similar to that which was used with Stuxnet.</li>
    <li>The Centers for Disease Control <span style="color:red">-(CDC) have already successfully used published DNA
        sequences as a prototype to reconstruct the virus responsible for the Spanish flu,</span> which was one of the
      deadliest pandemics ever.</li>
    <li>Scientists in Israel have shown that <span style="color:red">-it is possible to fabricate DNA evidence.</span>
      These scientists ‚Äúfabricated blood and saliva samples containing DNA from a person other than the donor of the
      blood and saliva. They also showed that <span style="color:red">-if they had access to a DNA profile in a
        database, they could construct a sample of DNA to match that profile without obtaining any tissue from that
        person.‚Äù</span></li>
    <li>Giovanni Vigna, professor of computer science at University of California Santa Barbara and co-founder of
      Lastline, has suggested that <span style="color:red">-hackers might start selling DNA data back for ransom.</span>
      Hackers could also threaten to ‚Äúrevoke access or post the sensitive information online if not given money; one
      Indiana hospital paid $55,000 to hackers for this very reason.‚Äù</li>
    <li>There are other reasons why genetic data could be lucrative. <span style="color:red">-‚ÄúThis data could be sold
        on the down-low or monetized to insurance companies,‚Äù Vigna cautions.</span> ‚ÄúYou can imagine the consequences:
      One day, I might apply for a long-term loan and get rejected because deep in the corporate system, there is data
      that I am very likely to get Alzheimer‚Äôs and die before I would repay the loan.‚Äù</li>
    <li>Stolen DNA could be <span style="color:red">-planted in order to incriminate someone.</span></li>
    <li>It could be used to <span style="color:red">-receive or deny medical treatment.</span></li>
    <li>It could be <span style="color:red">-used to mask a genetic condition,</span> in the same way people will
      purchase clean urine so they can pass a drug test.</li>
    <li>Security researchers were able to <span style="color:red">-infect a computer with malware embedded in a strand
        of human DNA.</span></li>
    <br>
    Peccoud and Gallegos write that, "With the help of computers, editing and writing DNA sequences are almost as easy
    as manipulating text documents. And it can be done with malicious intent." Rashmi Knowles, EMEA Field CTO at RSA
    Security has commented that, ‚Äúmany people don‚Äôt think about this when applying for such services. No matter how
    secure the organization, no one is completely risk-free, and if breached, genetic data could be sold on hackers
    without your consent, or the characteristic data it contains could be used to hijack your online accounts.‚Äù
  </ul>
  <br>
  <center>
    <h2>DNA Testing Kits</h2>
  </center>
  <p>According to The Verge: <br> <br> ‚ÄúMyHeritage doesn‚Äôt offer health or medical tests, but many companies, like
    23andMe and Helix, do. And there are plenty of players interested in DNA: researchers want genetic data for
    scientific studies, insurance companies want genetic data to help them calculate the cost of health and life
    insurance, and <span style="color:green">+police want genetic data to help them track down criminals, like in the
      recent Golden State Killer case.</span> Already, we lack robust protections when it comes to genetic privacy, and
    so <span style="color:red;">-a genetic data breach could be a nightmare. ‚ÄúIf there is data that exists, there is a
      way for it to be exploited,‚Äù says Natalie Ram, a professor of law focusing on bioethics issues at the University
      of Baltimore.</span> <br> <br> <span style="color:orange">Genetic testing sites are treasure troves of sensitive
      information.</span> Some sites offer users the option to download a copy of their full genetic code while others
    don‚Äôt. But the full genetic code isn‚Äôt the most valuable information anyway. As Ram points out, we can‚Äôt just read
    genetic code like a book to gain insights. Instead, it‚Äôs the easy-to-access account pages with health
    interpretations that are most useful for hackers.‚Äù<br> <br> Risky across the board <br> <br> Then too, there is
    forensic use of genetic databases, such as the FBI's DNA Index System (CODIS) and the public genealogy database
    GEDmatch, both of which were described by Science Magazine as ‚Äúnothing less than ‚Äúhaphazard and underregulated."
    <br>
    <br> Researchers at the Center for the Study of Weapons of Mass Destruction at the National Defense University point
    out
    that both researchers and bio-industrial companies store and use genomic data on computers, local area networks
    and/or
    cloud services and transfer the data between users over email or other sharing technologies. Hence, it is ‚Äúexposed
    at
    many touch points throughout their use to the risks and vulnerabilities common to cyberspace such as hacking, data
    theft, sabotage, and unauthorized access. In most cases, only minimal encryption or other cybersecurity safeguards
    are
    used to secure genomic data at these touch points in the information life cycle.‚Äù<br> <br> The researchers go on to
    warn that these risks are exacerbated by an overall lack of awareness among scientists andresearchers, in addition
    to the need for effective measures for protecting genomic data in the first place. They also
    argue that the securing of genomic data should not be viewed merely as a subset of cybersecurity, because
    safeguarding
    of genomic data necessitates an understanding of how bio-scientists use and could potentially misuse such
    information.‚Äù

  <p>Long-dead actors continue to achieve a sort of immortality in their films. A new controversy over dead actors is
    coming to life based upon new uses of visual effects and computer-generated imagery (CGI). Instead of simply <span
      style="color:green;">üòê+using CGI to create stunning action sequences, gorgeous backdrops, and imaginary
      monsters,</span> <span style="color:orange;"> film makers have started to use its technological wonders to bring
      back actors from the grave.</span> What ethical problems circle around the use of digital reincarnations in film
    making?

    <br>
    The use of CGI to change the look of actors is nothing new. For instance, many films have used such <span
      style="color:green;">+CGI methods to digitally de-age actors with striking results</span> (like those found in the
    Marvel films), or <span style="color:green;">üòê+to create spectacular creatures without much physical reality (such
      as ‚ÄúGollum‚Äù in The Lord of the Rings series).</span> What happens when CGI places an actor into a film through the
    intervention of technology? A recent example of digital reincarnation in the film industry is found in Fast and
    Furious 7, where Paul Walker had to be digitally recreated due to his untimely death in the middle of the film‚Äôs
    production. <span style="color:orange;">Walker‚Äôs brothers had to step in to give a physical form for the visual
      effect artists to finish off Walker‚Äôs character in the movie,</span> and the results brought about mixed reviews
    as <span style="color:red;">üòê-some viewers thought it was ‚Äúodd‚Äù that they were seeing a deceased actor on screen
      that was recreated digitally.</span> However,<span style="color:green;">+many argue that this was the best course
      of action to take in order to complete film production and honor Paul Walker‚Äôs work and character.</span>
    <br>
    <span style="color:purple;"> Comment: The purpose of digitalizing Paul Walker was to help finish the movie due to
      his death in the middle of film-making.</span> <br> <br>
    <span style="color:purple;"> Comment: The film production company benefits because they were able to release the movie to the public without issue. Paul Walker was honored in his last movie after his unexpected death.</span> <br> <br>
    <span style="color:purple;"> Comment: I believe that these impacts are unintended because CGI is being used to recreate actors for movies to try a tell a proper story. The filmmakers don't know if there will be consequences
      to using CGI of dead actors.</span>
    <br>
    <br>
    Other recent films have continued to bet on using CGI to help recreate characters on the silver screen. For
    instance, 2016‚Äôs Rogue One: A Star War Story used advanced CGI techniques that hint at the ethical problems that lie
    ahead for film-makers. Peter Cushing was first featured in 1977‚Äôs Star Wars: A New Hope as Grand Moff Tarkin. In the
    Star Wars timeline, the events that take place in Rogue One lead directly into A New Hope, so the story writers
    behind the recent Rogue One felt inclined to include Grand Moff Tarkin as a key character in the events leading up
    to the next film. There was one problem, however: Peter Cushing died in 1994. <span style="color:orange;">The film
      producers were faced with an interesting problem and ultimately decided to use CGI to digitally resurrect Cushing
      from the grave to reprise his role as the Imperial officer.</span> The result of this addition of Grand Moff
    Tarkin in the final cut of the film sent shockwaves across the Star Wars fandom, with some presenting arguments in
    defense of adding Cushing‚Äôs character into the film by claiming that ‚Äúactors don‚Äôt own characters‚Äù (Tylt.com) and
    that the fact that the character looked the same over the course of the fictional timeline enhanced the aesthetic
    effects of the movies. Others, like Catherine Shoard, were more critical. <span style="color:red;">üòê-She condemned
      the film‚Äôs risky choice saying, ‚Äúthough Cushing‚Äôs estate approved his use in Rogue One,</span> I‚Äôm not convinced
    that if I had built up a formidable acting career, I‚Äôd then want to turn in a performance I had bupkis to do with.‚Äù
    Rich Haridy of New Atlas also expressed some criticism over the use of Peter Cushing in the recent Star Wars film by
    writing, <span style="color:red;">-‚Äúthere is something inherently unnerving about watching such a perfect simulacrum
      of someone you know cannot exist.‚Äù</span>
    <br>
    <br>
      This use of CGI to bring back dead actors and place them into film raises troubling questions about consent.
      Assuming that actors should only appear in films that they choose to, how can we be assured that such post-mortem
      uses are consistent with the actor‚Äôs wishes? Is gaining permission from the relatives of the deceased enough to
      use an actor‚Äôs image or likeness? <span style="color:red;">pan =üòê-Additionally, the possibility is increased that
        CGI can be used to bring unwilling figures into a film.</span> Many films have employed look-alikes to bring
      presidents or historical figures into a narrative; the possibility of using CGI to bring in exact versions of
      actors and celebrities into films does not seem that different from this tactic. <span style="color:red;">üòê-This
        filmic use of CGI actors also extends our worries over ‚Äúdeepfakes‚Äù (AI-created fake videos) and falsified videos
        into the murkier realm of fictional products and narratives.</span> While we like continuity in actors as a way
      to preserve our illusion of reality in films, what ethical pitfalls await us as we CGI the undead‚Äîor the
      unwilling‚Äîinto our films or artworks?</p>
