    <tr>
      <td>What is being <strong>digitized?</strong></td>
      <td>Dead actors were being digitized to bring them back into films through CGI (Computer-generated Images).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>What is the <u>goal</u>or <u>purpose</u> of digitizing this thing?</td>
      <td>The purpose of digitizing dead actors like Paul Walker was to either finish the movie or be used to make
        actors in films look younger to the audience.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is someone <strong><span style="color:green">benefiting</span></strong> from this situation? If so, who?</td>
      <td>The benefits include the film-making company being able to release the movie to the public without issue.
        Also, actors like Paul Walker could be honored in their last movies after their death.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is someone being <strong><span style="color:maroon">harmed</span></strong> in this situation? If so, who?</td>
      <td>The potential harm could happen to the audience watching the film or family members of the actors because they could be emotionally hurt as the actor has already died. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is our world <strong><span style="color:green">better</span> OR <span style="color:maroon">worse</span></strong> because of digital representation? Explain why, giving examples from the
      article.</td>
      <td>I believe that CGI can make our world better. CGI can help teach our generation and even future generations
        about actors and famous people of the past into the present. Bringing back dead actors, like Paul Walker was
        used to honor his career and to complete his movie.</td>
