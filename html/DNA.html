      <tr>
        <td>What is being <strong>digitized?</strong></td>
        <td>DNA, which was obtained through direct-to-consumer DNA testing services was digitized.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>What is the <u>goal</u>or <u>purpose</u> of digitizing this thing?</td>
        <td>The goal of digitizing DNA was help find cures for fatal diseases, but it inadvertently raised security concerns through cyber threats.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Is someone <strong><span style="color:green">benefiting</span></strong> from this situation? If so, who?</td>
        <td> The benefits of Digitizing DNA include helping individuals seek their health information and assisting the police with criminal cases that are undergoing investigation.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Is someone being <strong><span style="color:maroon">harmed</span></strong> in this situation? If so, who?</td>
        <td>The harms of Digitizing DNA include the exploitation of people's genetic data that can be beached, or through framing an innocent individual in a crime scene.</td>

        <td>Is our world <strong><span style="color:green">better</span> OR <span style="color:maroon">worse</span></strong> because of digital representation? Explain why, giving examples from the
        article.</td>
        <td>The digitalization of DNA was made to help people discover their medical information and assist police with crime scene investigations. However, Our world might be worse from this <strong>Digitization</strong> because hackers could steal and hack genetic information during data breaches, which can cause them to exploit people for money or frame them in a crime.</td>
