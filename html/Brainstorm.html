   <center><h1>Brainstorming</h1></center>
    <p>We split up the 3 articles upon on us and then created a wireframe to lay out our work to see how we wanted to format it and how we wanted to display our information. Afterwards, we each took a specific part in the webpage and worked on our article page. We then started working on the CSS together and fixing tweaks to make everything look more polished.</p>

    <center><h2>Proudest Accomplishment</h2></center>
    <p>We feel most proudest of how intricate we made the pages and connecting the pages.</p>

    <center><h2>Difficulties</h2></center>
    <p>However, the most difficult part about the project was the annotations because we had some struggles figuring out how to highlight the text.</p>
