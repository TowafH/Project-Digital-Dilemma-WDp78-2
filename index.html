    <h3>While doing this group project we learned about the impact of technology in our society and how big of a role it plays on everything around us. On the other hand we also learned the value of teamwork and how important communication is. As well as, creating a wireframe before any project is very helpful since it guides us through the project. We evenly split up the tasks meaning each of us did an article and we all contributed to the CSS. Having a leader on this project really helped keep everything in order and made everything efficient.</h3>
